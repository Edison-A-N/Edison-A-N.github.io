# Notes

> Predictive AI aims to understand patterns in data and make informed predictions.

> - Collection and organizing data: This step deals with gathering data that needs to be analyzed. Ensuring that the data sourced is suitable for the task.
> - Preprocessing: Raw data in itself possess little to no value. It is essential for this data to be filtered out and for abnormalities or errors to be taken out to ensure that only correctly formatted records are passed into the model.
> - Feature and algorithm selection: The correct algorithm or model selection is essential to predictive AI. The result can only be accurate to the algorithm's level of accuracy. After selecting the right algorithm, training it on specific features to detect is also essential to achieving the desired results.
> - Model evaluation: After a successful algorithm process, evaluating the result based on a defined benchmark is essential to weigh the accuracy of the given results.

> Generative AI is a type of AI used to generate content based on prompts.

> Unlike predictive AI, which is used to analyze data and predict forecasts, generative AI learns from available data and generates new data from its knowledge.
